DISEASES OF THE LUNGS AND PLEURA—TUBERCULOSIS
Ratings for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Entitled on August 19, 1968
6701   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, far advanced, active 100
6702   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, moderately advanced, active 100
6703   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, minimal, active 100
6704   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, active, advancement unspecified 100
6721   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, far advanced, inactive
6722   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, moderately advanced, inactive
6723   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, minimal, inactive
6724   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, inactive, advancement unspecified
General Rating Formula for Inactive Pulmonary Tuberculosis: For two years after date of inactivity, following active tuberculosis, which was clinically identified during
service or subsequently
100
Thereafter for four years, or in any event, to six years after date of inactivity 50
Thereafter, for five years, or to eleven years after date of inactivity 30
Following far advanced lesions diagnosed at any time while the disease process was active, minimum 30
Following moderately advanced lesions, provided there is continued disability, emphysema, dyspnea on exertion, impairment of health, etc 20
Otherwise 0
Note (1): The 100-percent rating under codes 6701 through 6724 is not subject to a requirement of precedent hospital treatment. It will be reduced to 50 percent for
failure to submit to examination or to follow prescribed treatment upon report to that effect from the medical authorities. When a veteran is placed on the 100-percent
rating for inactive tuberculosis, the medical authorities will be appropriately notified of the fact, and of the necessity, as given in footnote 1 to 38 U.S.C. 1156 (and
formerly in 38 U.S.C. 356, which has been repealed by Public Law 90-493), to notify the Veterans Service Center in the event of failure to submit to examination or to
follow treatment.
Note (2): The graduated 50-percent and 30-percent ratings and the permanent 30 percent and 20 percent ratings for inactive pulmonary tuberculosis are not to be
combined with ratings for other respiratory disabilities. Following thoracoplasty the rating will be for removal of ribs combined with the rating for collapsed lung.
Resection of the ribs incident to thoracoplasty will be rated as removal.
Ratings for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Initially Evaluated After August 19, 1968
6730   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, active 100
Note: Active pulmonary tuberculosis will be considered permanently and totally disabling for non-service-connected pension purposes in the following circumstances:
(a) Associated with active tuberculosis involving other than the respiratory system.
(b) With severe associated symptoms or with extensive cavity formation.
(c) Reactivated cases, generally.
(d) With advancement of lesions on successive examinations or while under treatment.
(e) Without retrogression of lesions or other evidence of material improvement at the end of six months hospitalization or without change of diagnosis from “active” at the
end of 12 months hospitalization. Material improvement means lessening or absence of clinical symptoms, and X-ray findings of a stationary or retrogressive lesion.
6731   Tuberculosis, pulmonary, chronic, inactive:
Depending on the specific findings, rate residuals as interstitial lung disease, restrictive lung disease, or, when obstructive lung disease is the major residual, as chronic
bronchitis (DC 6600). Rate thoracoplasty as removal of ribs under DC 5297.
Note: A mandatory examination will be requested immediately following notification that active tuberculosis evaluated under DC 6730 has become inactive. Any change
in evaluation will be carried out under the provisions of §3.105(e).
6732   Pleurisy, tuberculous, active or inactive:
Rate under §§4.88c or 4.89, whichever is appropriate.

ventricular dysfunction

Symptomatic, following resolution of acute pulmonary embolism 30
Asymptomatic, following resolution of pulmonary thromboembolism 0
Note: Evaluate other residuals following pulmonary embolism under the most appropriate diagnostic code, such as chronic bronchitis (DC 6600) or chronic pleural
effusion or fibrosis (DC 6844), but do not combine that evaluation with any of the above evaluations.
6819   Neoplasms, malignant, any specified part of respiratory system exclusive of skin growths 100
Note: A rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the cessation of any surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure. Six months after
discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating shall be determined by mandatory VA examination. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any
subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of §3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals.
6820   Neoplasms, benign, any specified part of respiratory system. Evaluate using an appropriate respiratory analogy.
Bacterial Infections of the Lung
6822   Actinomycosis.
6823   Nocardiosis.
6824   Chronic lung abscess.
General Rating Formula for Bacterial Infections of the Lung (diagnostic codes 6822 through 6824):

Depending on the specific findings, rate residuals as interstitial lung disease, restrictive lung disease, or, when obstructive lung disease is the major residual, as chronic

6832   Pneumoconiosis (silicosis, anthracosis, etc.).
6833   Asbestosis.
General Rating Formula for Interstitial Lung Disease (diagnostic codes 6825 through 6833):
Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) less than 50-percent predicted, or; Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method (DLCO (SB)) less than
40-percent predicted, or; maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption with cardiorespiratory limitation, or; cor pulmonale or pulmonary
hypertension, or; requires outpatient oxygen therapy
100
FVC of 50- to 64-percent predicted, or; DLCO (SB) of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or; maximum exercise capacity of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption with

Chronic pulmonary mycosis with minimal symptoms such as occasional minor hemoptysis or productive cough 30
Healed and inactive mycotic lesions, asymptomatic 0
Note: Coccidioidomycosis has an incubation period up to 21 days, and the disseminated phase is ordinarily manifest within six months of the primary phase. However,
there are instances of dissemination delayed up to many years after the initial infection which may have been unrecognized. Accordingly, when service connection is
under consideration in the absence of record or other evidence of the disease in service, service in southwestern United States where the disease is endemic and
absence of prolonged residence in this locality before or after service will be the deciding factor.

Or rate primary disorder.
Note (1): A 100-percent rating shall be assigned for pleurisy with empyema, with or without pleurocutaneous fistula, until resolved.
