(a) For the purposes of this section, systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin, and topical
therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin.
(b) Two or more skin conditions may be combined in accordance with §4.25 only if separate areas of skin are involved. If two or more skin conditions involve the same area of skin,
then only the highest evaluation shall be used.

Note (1):The 8 characteristics of disfigurement, for purposes of evaluation under §4.118, are:
Scar 5 or more inches (13 or more cm.) in length.
Scar at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at widest part.
Surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation.
Scar adherent to underlying tissue.
Skin hypo-or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).
Skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).
Underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).
Skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).
Note (2): Rate tissue loss of the auricle under DC 6207 (loss of auricle) and anatomical loss of the eye under DC 6061 (anatomical loss of both eyes) or DC 6063 (anatomical
loss of one eye), as appropriate.
Note (3): Take into consideration unretouched color photographs when evaluating under these criteria.
Note (4): Separately evaluate disabling effects other than disfigurement that are associated with individual scar(s) of the head, face, or neck, such as pain, instability, and
residuals of associated muscle or nerve injury, under the appropriate diagnostic code(s) and apply §4.25 to combine the evaluation(s) with the evaluation assigned under this
diagnostic code.
Note (5): The characteristic(s) of disfigurement may be caused by one scar or by multiple scars; the characteristic(s) required to assign a particular evaluation need not be
caused by a single scar in order to assign that evaluation.

the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk
Note (2): A separate evaluation may be assigned for each affected zone of the body under this diagnostic code if there are multiple scars, or a single scar, affecting multiple
zones of the body. Combine the separate evaluations under §4.25. Alternatively, if a higher evaluation would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the
body, a single evaluation may also be assigned under this diagnostic code

the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk
Note (2): A separate evaluation may be assigned for each affected zone of the body under this diagnostic code if there are multiple scars, or a single scar, affecting multiple
