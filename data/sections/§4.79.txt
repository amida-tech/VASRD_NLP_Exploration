Diseases of the Eye
   Rating
General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye:
Evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to the particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 60
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 5 but less than 7 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 40
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 3 but less than 5 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 20
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 10
Note (1): For the purposes of evaluation under 38 CFR 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for
treatment purposes
Note (2): Examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: Systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or
other surgical interventions
Note (3): For the purposes of evaluating visual impairment due to the particular condition, refer to 38 CFR 4.75-4.78 and to §4.79, diagnostic codes 6061-6091
6000   Choroidopathy, including uveitis, iritis, cyclitis, or choroiditis.
6001   Keratopathy.
6002   Scleritis.
6006   Retinopathy or maculopathy not otherwise specified
6007   Intraocular hemorrhage.
6008   Detachment of retina.
6009   Unhealed eye injury.
Note: This code includes orbital trauma, as well as penetrating or non-penetrating eye injury
6010   Tuberculosis of eye:
Active 100
Inactive: Evaluate under §4.88c or §4.89 of this part, whichever is appropriate
6011   Retinal scars, atrophy, or irregularities:
Localized scars, atrophy, or irregularities of the retina, unilateral or bilateral, that are centrally located and that result in an irregular, duplicated, enlarged, or diminished image 10
Alternatively, evaluate based on the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye, if this would result in a higher evaluation
6012   Angle-closure glaucoma
Evaluate under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye. Minimum evaluation if continuous medication is required 10
6013   Open-angle glaucoma
Evaluate under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye. Minimum evaluation if continuous medication is required 10
6014   Malignant neoplasms of the eye, orbit, and adnexa (excluding skin):
Malignant neoplasms of the eye, orbit, and adnexa (excluding skin) that require therapy that is comparable to those used for systemic malignancies, i.e., systemic
chemotherapy, X-ray therapy more extensive than to the area of the eye, or surgery more extensive than enucleation
100
Note: Continue the 100 percent rating beyond the cessation of any surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedure. Six months after

discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating will be determined by mandatory VA examination. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any
subsequent examination will be subject to the provisions of §3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, evaluate based on residuals
Malignant neoplasms of the eye, orbit, and adnexa (excluding skin) that do not require therapy comparable to that for systemic malignancies:
Separately evaluate visual and nonvisual impairment, e.g., disfigurement (diagnostic code 7800), and combine the evaluations
