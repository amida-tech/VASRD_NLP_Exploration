Diseases of the Ear
   Rating
6200   Chronic suppurative otitis media, mastoiditis, or cholesteatoma (or any combination):
During suppuration, or with aural polyps 10
Note: Evaluate hearing impairment, and complications such as labyrinthitis, tinnitus, facial nerve paralysis, or bone loss of skull, separately.
6201   Chronic nonsuppurative otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media):
Rate hearing impairment
6202   Otosclerosis:
Rate hearing impairment
6204   Peripheral vestibular disorders:
Dizziness and occasional staggering 30
Occasional dizziness 10
Note: Objective findings supporting the diagnosis of vestibular disequilibrium are required before a compensable evaluation can be assigned under this code. Hearing
impairment or suppuration shall be separately rated and combined.

6205   Meniere's syndrome (endolymphatic hydrops):
Hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring more than once weekly, with or without tinnitus 100
Hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring from one to four times a month, with or without tinnitus 60
Hearing impairment with vertigo less than once a month, with or without tinnitus 30
Note: Evaluate Meniere's syndrome either under these criteria or by separately evaluating vertigo (as a peripheral vestibular disorder), hearing impairment, and tinnitus,
whichever method results in a higher overall evaluation. But do not combine an evaluation for hearing impairment, tinnitus, or vertigo with an evaluation under diagnostic
code 6205.
6207 Loss of auricle:
Complete loss of both 50
Complete loss of one 30
Deformity of one, with loss of one-third or more of the substance 10
6208   Malignant neoplasm of the ear (other than skin only) 100
Note: A rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the cessation of any surgical, radiation treatment, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure. Six
months after discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating shall be determined by mandatory VA examination. Any change in evaluation based on that or
any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of ยง3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals.
6209   Benign neoplasms of the ear (other than skin only):
Rate on impairment of function.
6210   Chronic otitis externa:
Swelling, dry and scaly or serous discharge, and itching requiring frequent and prolonged treatment 10
6211   Tympanic membrane, perforation of 0
6260   Tinnitus, recurrent 10
Note (1): A separate evaluation for tinnitus may be combined with an evaluation under diagnostic codes 6100, 6200, 6204, or other diagnostic code, except when tinnitus
supports an evaluation under one of those diagnostic codes.
Note (2): Assign only a single evaluation for recurrent tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived in one ear, both ears, or in the head.
Note (3): Do not evaluate objective tinnitus (in which the sound is audible to other people and has a definable cause that may or may not be pathologic) under this diagnostic
code, but evaluate it as part of any underlying condition causing it.
