Note: When evaluating any claim involving loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs, refer to §3.350 of this chapter to determine whether the veteran may be entitled
to special monthly compensation. Footnotes in the schedule indicate conditions which potentially establish entitlement to special monthly compensation; however, there are
other conditions in this section which under certain circumstances also establish entitlement to special monthly compensation.

7507   Nephrosclerosis, arteriolar:
Rate according to predominant symptoms as renal dysfunction, hypertension or heart disease. If rated under the cardiovascular schedule, however, the percentage rating
which would otherwise be assigned will be elevated to the next higher evaluation.
7508   Nephrolithiasis:

1. diet therapy
2. drug therapy
3. invasive or non-invasive procedures more than two times/year 30
7509   Hydronephrosis:
Severe; Rate as renal dysfunction.

Note: In cases of the removal of one testis as the result of a service-incurred injury or disease, other than an undescended or congenitally undeveloped testis, with the
absence or nonfunctioning of the other testis unrelated to service, an evaluation of 30 percent will be assigned for the service-connected testicular loss. Testis,
underscended, or congenitally undeveloped is not a ratable disability.

Rate as voiding dysfunction or urinary tract infection, whichever is predominant.
7528   Malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system 100
Note—Following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure, the rating of 100 percent shall continue with a mandatory VA
examination at the expiration of six months. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of §3.105(e) of this
chapter. If there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant.
7529   Benign neoplasms of the genitourinary system:
Rate as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant.

7530   Chronic renal disease requiring regular dialysis:
Rate as renal dysfunction.
7531   Kidney transplant:
Following transplant surgery 100
Thereafter: Rate on residuals as renal dysfunction, minimum rating 30
Note—The 100 percent evaluation shall be assigned as of the date of hospital admission for transplant surgery and shall continue with a mandatory VA examination one year
following hospital discharge. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of §3.105(e) of this chapter.
7532   Renal tubular disorders (such as renal glycosurias, aminoacidurias, renal tubular acidosis, Fanconi's syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, related disorders of Henle's loop

7533   Cystic diseases of the kidneys (polycystic disease, uremic medullary cystic disease, Medullary sponge kidney, and similar conditions):
Rate as renal dysfunction.
7534   Atherosclerotic renal disease (renal artery stenosis or atheroembolic renal disease):
