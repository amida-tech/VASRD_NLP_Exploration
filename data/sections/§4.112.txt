For purposes of evaluating conditions in §4.114, the term “substantial weight loss” means a loss of greater than 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three
months or longer; and the term “minor weight loss” means a weight loss of 10 to 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer. The term
“inability to gain weight” means that there has been substantial weight loss with inability to regain it despite appropriate therapy. “Baseline weight” means the average weight for the
two-year-period preceding onset of the disease.
