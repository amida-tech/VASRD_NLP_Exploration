personality disorders.
Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) and personality disorders are not diseases or injuries for compensation purposes, and, except as provided in ยง3.310(a) of
this chapter, disability resulting from them may not be service-connected. However, disability resulting from a mental disorder that is superimposed upon intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) or a personality disorder may be service-connected.
