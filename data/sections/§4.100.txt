7011, and 7015-7020.
(a) Whether or not cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation (documented by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray) is present and whether or not there is a need for continuous
medication must be ascertained in all cases.
(b) Even if the requirement for a 10% (based on the need for continuous medication) or 30% (based on the presence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation) evaluation is met, METs
testing is required in all cases except:
(1) When there is a medical contraindication.
(2) When the left ventricular ejection fraction has been measured and is 50% or less.
(3) When chronic congestive heart failure is present or there has been more than one episode of congestive heart failure within the past year.
(4) When a 100% evaluation can be assigned on another basis.
(c) If left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) testing is not of record, evaluate based on the alternative criteria unless the examiner states that the LVEF test is needed in a particular
case because the available medical information does not sufficiently reflect the severity of the veteran's cardiovascular disability.
