   Rating
Note 1: Natural menopause, primary amenorrhea, and pregnancy and childbirth are not disabilities for rating purposes. Chronic residuals of medical or surgical complications
of pregnancy may be disabilities for rating purposes.
Note 2: When evaluating any claim involving loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs or anatomical loss of one or both breasts, refer to ยง3.350 of this chapter to
determine whether the veteran may be entitled to special monthly compensation. Footnotes in the schedule indicate conditions which potentially establish entitlement to
special monthly compensation; however, almost any condition in this section might, under certain circumstances, establish entitlement to special monthly compensation.

General Rating Formula for Disease, Injury, or Adhesions of Female Reproductive Organs (diagnostic codes 7610 through 7615):
Symptoms not controlled by continuous treatment 30
Symptoms that require continuous treatment 10
Symptoms that do not require continuous treatment 0
Note: For the purpose of VA disability evaluation, a disease, injury, or adhesions of the ovaries resulting in ovarian dysfunction affecting the menstrual cycle, such as
dysmenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea, shall be rated under diagnostic code 7615
7617   Uterus and both ovaries, removal of, complete:
For three months after removal 100
Thereafter 50
7618   Uterus, removal of, including corpus:
1

1
For three months after removal 100
Thereafter 30
7619   Ovary, removal of:
For three months after removal 100
Thereafter:
Complete removal of both ovaries 30
Removal of one with or without partial removal of the other 0
Note: In cases of the removal of one ovary as the result of a service-connected injury or disease, with the absence or nonfunctioning of a second ovary unrelated to service,
an evaluation of 30 percent will be assigned for the service-connected ovarian loss
7620   Ovaries, atrophy of both, complete 20
7621   Complete or incomplete pelvic organ prolapse due to injury, disease, or surgical complications of pregnancy 10
Note: Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when a pelvic organ such as bladder, urethra, uterus, vagina, small bowel, or rectum drops (prolapse) from its normal place in the
abdomen. Conditions associated with pelvic organ prolapse include: uterine or vaginal vault prolapse, cystocele, urethrocele, rectocele, enterocele, or any combination
thereof. Evaluate pelvic organ prolapse under DC 7621. Evaluate separately any genitourinary, digestive, or skin symptoms under the appropriate diagnostic code(s) and
combine all evaluations with the 10 percent evaluation under DC 7621
7624   Fistula, rectovaginal:
Vaginal fecal leakage at least once a day requiring wearing of pad 100
Vaginal fecal leakage four or more times per week, but less than daily, requiring wearing of pad 60
Vaginal fecal leakage one to three times per week requiring wearing of pad 30
Vaginal fecal leakage less than once a week 10
Without leakage 0
7625   Fistula, urethrovaginal:
Multiple urethrovaginal fistulae 100
Requiring the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than four times per day 60
Requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed two to four times per day 40
Requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than two times per day 20
7626   Breast, surgery of:
Following radical mastectomy:
Both 80
One 50
Following modified radical mastectomy:
Both 60
One 40
Following simple mastectomy or wide local excision with significant alteration of size or form:
Both 50
One 30
Following wide local excision without significant alteration of size or form:
Both or one 0
Note: For VA purposes:
(1) Radical mastectomy means removal of the entire breast, underlying pectoral muscles, and regional lymph nodes up to the coracoclavicular ligament.
(2) Modified radical mastectomy means removal of the entire breast and axillary lymph nodes (in continuity with the breast). Pectoral muscles are left intact.
(3) Simple (or total) mastectomy means removal of all of the breast tissue, nipple, and a small portion of the overlying skin, but lymph nodes and muscles are left intact.
(4) Wide local excision (including partial mastectomy, lumpectomy, tylectomy, segmentectomy, and quadrantectomy) means removal of a portion of the breast tissue.
7627   Malignant neoplasms of gynecological system 100
Note: A rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the cessation of any surgical, radiation, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedures. Six months after
discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating shall be determined by mandatory VA examination. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any
subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of ยง3.105(e) of this chapter. Rate chronic residuals to include scars, lymphedema, disfigurement, and/or other
impairment of function under the appropriate diagnostic code(s) within the appropriate body system
7628   Benign neoplasms of gynecological system. Rate chronic residuals to include scars, lymphedema, disfigurement, and/or other impairment of function under the
appropriate diagnostic code(s) within the appropriate body system
7629   Endometriosis:
Lesions involving bowel or bladder confirmed by laparoscopy, pelvic pain or heavy or irregular bleeding not controlled by treatment, and bowel or bladder symptoms 50
Pelvic pain or heavy or irregular bleeding not controlled by treatment 30
Pelvic pain or heavy or irregular bleeding requiring continuous treatment for control 10
Note: Diagnosis of endometriosis must be substantiated by laparoscopy.
7630   Malignant neoplasms of the breast 100
Note: A rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the cessation of any surgical, radiation, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure. Six months after
discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating shall be determined by mandatory VA examination. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any
subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of ยง3.105(e) of this chapter. Rate chronic residuals according to impairment of function due to scars, lymphedema,
or disfigurement (e.g., limitation of arm, shoulder, and wrist motion, or loss of grip strength, or loss of sensation, or residuals from harvesting of muscles for reconstructive
purposes), and/or under diagnostic code 7626
7631   Benign neoplasms of the breast and other injuries of the breast. Rate chronic residuals according to impairment of function due to scars, lymphedema, or
disfigurement (e.g., limitation of arm, shoulder, and wrist motion, or loss of grip strength, or loss of sensation, or residuals from harvesting of muscles for reconstructive
purposes), and/or under diagnostic code 7626
