General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye:
Evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to the particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 10
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 10
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 10
With documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months 10
Note (1): For the purposes of evaluation under 38 CFR 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for
Note (3): For the purposes of evaluating visual impairment due to the particular condition, refer to 38 CFR 4.75-4.78 and to ยง4.79, diagnostic codes 6061-6091
Note: This code includes orbital trauma, as well as penetrating or non-penetrating eye injury
