[41 FR 34258, Aug. 13, 1976, as amended at 59 FR 2527, Jan. 18, 1994] The nephrosclerotic type, originating in hypertension or arteriosclerosis, develops slowly, with minimum laboratory findings, and is associated with
natural progress. Also, in the event that chronic renal disease has progressed to the point where regular dialysis is required, any coexisting hypertension or
heart disease will be separately rated. Separate ratings are not to be assigned for disability from disease of the heart and any form of nephritis, on account of the close interrelationships of
cardiovascular disabilities. Albuminuria alone is not nephritis, nor will the presence of transient albumin and casts following acute febrile illness be taken as nephritis.
