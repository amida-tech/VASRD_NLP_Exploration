[29 FR 6718, May 22, 1964, as amended at 61 FR 52700, Oct. 8, 1996] This will not, of course,
preclude the correction of erroneous ratings, nor will it preclude assignment of a rating in conformity with §4.7. The relevant principle enunciated in §4.125, entitled
“Diagnosis of mental disorders,” should have careful attention in this connection. The repercussion upon a current rating of service connection when change is made of a previously assigned diagnosis or etiology must be kept in mind. The aim should be the
reconciliation and continuance of the diagnosis or etiology upon which service connection for the disability had been granted.
