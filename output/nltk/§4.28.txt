Note (2): Diagnosis of disease, injury, or residuals will be cited, with diagnostic code number assigned from this rating schedule for conditions listed therein. The following ratings may be assigned, in lieu of ratings prescribed elsewhere, under the conditions stated for disability from any disease or injury. However, prestabilization ratings may be changed to a regular schedular total rating or one authorizing a greater benefit at any time. The
prestabilization 50-percent rating is not to be used in any case in which a rating of 50 percent or more is immediately assignable under the regular provisions. In each prestabilization
rating an examination will be requested to be accomplished not earlier than 6 months nor more than 12 months following discharge. Prestabilization ratings are for assignment in the immediate postdischarge period. [35 FR 11906, July 24, 1970]
