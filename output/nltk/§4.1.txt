Over a period of many years, a veteran's disability claim may require reratings in accordance with
changes in laws, medical knowledge and his or her physical or mental condition. It is thus essential, both in the examination and in the evaluation of disability, that each disability be
viewed in relation to its history. For the application of this schedule, accurate and fully descriptive medical examinations are required, with
emphasis upon the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition. The
percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual
conditions in civil occupations. [41 FR 11292, Mar. 18, 1976]
