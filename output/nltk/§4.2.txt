Different examiners, at different times, will not describe the same disability in the same language. Features of the disability which must have persisted unchanged may be
overlooked or a change for the better or worse may not be accurately appreciated or described. Each disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work. [41 FR 11292, Mar. 18, 1976]
