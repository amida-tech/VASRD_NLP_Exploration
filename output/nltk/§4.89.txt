The repealed section, however, still applies to the
case of any veteran who on August 19, 1968, was receiving or entitled to receive compensation for tuberculosis. [29 FR 6718, May 22, 1964, as amended at 34 FR 5062, Mar. 11, 1969; 43 FR 45361, Oct. 2, 1978]
The Respiratory System Public Law 90-493 repealed section 356 of title 38, United States Code which provided graduated ratings for inactive tuberculosis. These ratings are applicable only to veterans with nonpulmonary tuberculosis active on or after October 10, 1949. For example, tuberculosis of the hipjoint with residual ankylosis would be coded 5001-5250. L. 90-493 apply, the former
evaluations are retained in this section.
