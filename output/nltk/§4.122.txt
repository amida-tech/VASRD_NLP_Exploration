The manifestations of a chronic mental disorder
associated with psychomotor epilepsy, like those of the seizures, are protean in character. The seizure manifestations of psychomotor epilepsy vary from patient to patient and in the same patient from seizure to seizure. The term psychomotor epilepsy refers to a condition that is characterized by seizures and not uncommonly by a chronic psychiatric disturbance as well.
