Inquiry will be directed to these considerations:
(a) Less movement than normal (due to ankylosis, limitation or blocking, adhesions, tendon-tie-up, contracted scars, etc.). (b) More movement than normal (from flail joint, resections, nonunion of fracture, relaxation of ligaments, etc.). (c) Weakened movement (due to muscle injury, disease or injury of peripheral nerves, divided or lengthened tendons, etc.). Instability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, standing and weight-bearing are related
considerations. (f) Pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse. The lumbosacral articulation and both sacroiliac joints are
considered to be a group of minor joints, ratable on disturbance of lumbar spine functions. (e) Incoordination, impaired ability to execute skilled movements smoothly.
