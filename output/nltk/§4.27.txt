18, 1976, as amended at 70 FR 75399, Dec. 20, 2005] Thus,
rheumatoid (atrophic) arthritis rated as ankylosis of the lumbar spine should be coded “5002-5240.” In this way, the exact source of each rating can be easily identified. No other numbers than these listed or hereafter furnished are to be employed for rating purposes, with an exception as
described in this section, as to unlisted conditions. In the
citation of disabilities on rating sheets, the diagnostic terminology will be that of the medical examiner, with no attempt to translate the terms into schedule nomenclature. In the selection of code numbers, injuries will generally
be represented by the number assigned to the residual condition on the basis of which the rating is determined. This procedure will facilitate a close check of new and unlisted conditions, rated by analogy. [41 FR 11293, Mar.
