[53 FR 30262, Aug. 11, 1988, as amended at 73 FR 66549, Nov. 10, 2008; 74 FR 7648, Feb. 19, 2009; 83 FR 15320, Apr. For aphakic individuals not well adapted to contact lens correction or pseudophakic individuals not well adapted to intraocular lens implant, visual field examinations must be
conducted using Goldmann's equivalent IV/4e. See Table III for the normal extent (in degrees) of the visual fields at the 8 principal meridians (45 degrees apart). (c) Combination of visual field defect and decreased visual acuity. Examiners must use either Goldmann kinetic perimetry or automated perimetry using Humphrey Model 750, Octopus Model 101, or later versions of
these perimetric devices with simulated kinetic Goldmann testing capability. The examination report must document the results of either the tangent screen or of the 30-degree threshold visual field with the Goldmann III stimulus size. (b) Evaluation of visual fields.
