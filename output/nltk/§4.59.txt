It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed
injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. The joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and
passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint. Crepitation either in the soft tissues such as the tendons or ligaments, or crepitation within the joint
structures should be noted carefully as points of contact which are diseased. The intent of the schedule is to
recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. Sciatic neuritis is not uncommonly caused by arthritis of the spine. Muscle spasm will greatly assist the identification. Flexion elicits such manifestations.
