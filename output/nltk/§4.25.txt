18, 1976, as amended at 54 FR 27161, June 28, 1989; 54 FR 36029, Aug. 31, 1989; 83 FR 17756, Apr. The combined value, exactly as found in table I, will be combined with the degree of the third disability (in order of severity). The individual is thus 72 percent disabled, as shown in table I opposite 60 percent and under 30 percent. Thus, a person having a 60 percent disability is considered 40 percent efficient. This combined value will then be converted to the nearest
number divisible by 10, and combined values ending in 5 will be adjusted upward. This 76 will be combined with 20 and the combined value for the three is 81 percent. This combined value will be converted to the nearest degree divisible by 10 which
is 80 percent.
